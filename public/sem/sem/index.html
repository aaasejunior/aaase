<ul>
<li>Engage in important discussions of our times</li>
<li>Encourage action and initiatives</li>
<li>Build a community to learn, grow, and have fun together!</li>
</ul>
<p>Each semester, we collect topic proposals that fall under a common theme. We then ask project leads to share the proposal with the public and invite
participants to form focus groups. The project lead is expected to organize focus group discussions, and each group will decide their timeline and
deliverables. Each project is expected to take 3-4 months.</p>

<h1 id="initiative-1">Initiative 1:</h1>
<h2 id="invisible-minority-falling-in-a-data-gap">Invisible Minority: Falling in a Data Gap</h2>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>Asian Americans are the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. and make up for nearly 7% of the nationâ€™s population. Meanwhile, we are the most
understudied major racial or ethnic group in U.S. peer-reviewed literature with only 0.18% of funding from the National Institutes of Health from 2000 to
2018 that supported Asian American health research. Health disparities persist with notable examples such as the fact that Asian Americans are the only
racial/ethnic group in the U.S. for whom cancer is the leading cause of death. Moreover, Asian Americans are often considered as one group in research and
analysis, which fails to recognize the disparity within this umbrella category. For example, the CDC data shows that Asian Americans are at a lower risk
for COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death compared to other ethnic groups. However, disaggregated data show that Chinese patients have the
highest death rates across all racial and ethnic groups. Such disaggregated statistics are critical for designing policies and health campaigns to provide
more equitable and effective health outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="project-focus">Project focus</h3>
<p>In this seminar project, we investigate how aggregation of the diverse Asian American population into one ethnic group masks important differences in
health, health risk, health care access within this community and perpetuates health and health care disparity. The group will read peer-reviewed articles
together, collect relevant statistics to support our analysis, and draft an article together on this topic. We will seek to have this co-authored article
reviewed by an expert and published on a public platform (e.g. as an op-ed, white paper, etc.).</p>
<h1 id="initiative-2">Initiative 2:</h1>
<h2 id="healthcare-inequity-in-the-bone-marrow-donor-registry">Healthcare Inequity in the Bone marrow donor registry</h2>
<h3 id="why-1">Why?</h3>
<p>Every year, thousands of people are diagnosed with a life-threatening disease, like leukemia, lymphoma, or sickle-cell anemia, and depend on a bone marrow
transplant to survive. In order to find a matching donor for a transplant, patients rely on registries where potential donors are listed. Donors must be
between 18 and 40 years old, as patient survival rates are linked to donor age. On the Be The Match registry, which is the most diverse marrow registry in
the world, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders face a 47% chance of finding a matching donor (compared to 79% for white patients). The probability of
finding a matching donor increases within the same ethnic/racial group, so this significant disparity is a vital issue for Asians and Asian Americans
seeking a life-saving bone marrow transplant.</p>
<h3 id="project-focus-1">Project focus</h3>
<p>Over three stages, this initiative seeks to raise greater awareness on this issue of health inequity for the AAPI community, address common
misunderstandings surrounding bone marrow donation, and encourage Asian American youth to become advocates in their local communities. First, AAASE Junior
Board aims to launch a social media information campaign, focused on reaching younger Asian Americans in the bone marrow donor age range (18-40). We are
partnering with Princetonâ€™s Asian American Students Association to organize an AAPI bone marrow donor recruitment drive at Princeton University in Fall of
2022. AAASE Junior Board will compile the content generated over the course of the project into an information package including a reference manual for
organizing a recruitment drive. This guide will be published as an open resource for Asian American youth seeking to become involved in advocacy efforts
and community mobilization.</p>
<h1 id="initiative-3">Initiative 3:</h1>
<h2 id="aapi-youth-mental-health-awareness">AAPI Youth mental health awareness</h2>
<h3 id="why-2">Why?</h3>
<p>Asian American youth are at a high risk of mental health disorders, especially depression and suicide.  AAPI youth struggle significantly from the â€˜model
minorityâ€™ stereotype, which is a microaggression known as â€˜ascription of intelligenceâ€™.  They can also be impacted on other race-based issues, including
the perpetual foreigner stereotype, high family and social expectation, immigration trauma, and religious and family intolerance.
Studies have shown that suicide is the leading cause of death for AAPI youth (ages 15 to 24), and AAPI high school males are 30% more likely to consider
attempting suicide compare to non-Hispanic white males.  However, Asian Americans are least likely to receive treatment for mental health issues compared
to other racial or ethnic groups.  In 2020, 6.1% of the US population identified as Asian American or Pacific Islander.  Among them, 15% reported
(self-reporting) having a mental illness in the past year, but only 20.8% Asian adults with a mental illness received treatment.  Therefore, mental health
awareness and early treatment of mental illness in AAPI youth is crucial for the health and wellness among our community.</p>
<h3 id="project-focus-2">Project focus</h3>
<p>The first topic we plan to focus on is high expectation related stress and anxieties in Asian American youth. Our initiative aims to create a safe zone
for students to have open conversations with their peers about mental health and mental health awareness. We will hold a student-led panel with experts in
Mental Health and Asian American Studies to discuss causes of high expectation towards Asian American youth and the stress and anxiety related to it.<br>
After the expert panel, we plan to have a case study/journal club event where students read and discuss mental health issues in Asian American youth. The
participants in this initiative will mainly be high school and college students.  We also welcome parents who are interested and passionate about the
topic to participate.</p>
