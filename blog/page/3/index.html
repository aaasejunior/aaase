  <p>itsdangerous 1.1.0 has been released to fix compatibility issues that were affecting projects while upgrading. Due to these issues, we had to make a quick decision and pull itsdangerous 1.0.0 from PyPI earlier today to prevent more projects from being affected. We appologize for the difficulty this caused, and the changes in this release should address compatibilty going forward.</p>
<p>1.0.0 changed the default digest algorithm from SHA-1 to SHA-512. SHA-1 as used by itsdangerous was never suceptible to the collision issue published last year, but the change was made for peace of mind. However, this change invalidated existing signatures that were in use.</p>
<p>To address this, 1.1.0 reverts the default digest to SHA-1. It also adds a fallback mechanism to try other algorithms when unsigning. This gives projects a safe way to upgrade signing parameters in the future, while still supporting existing signatures during the upgrade period. A default fallback for SHA-512 was added to support projects that were already affected by the 1.0.0 version. 1.1.0 is therefore compatible with both 0.24 and 1.0.0, so upgrading should be safe in either case.</p>
<p>Additionally, we reverted a change to the project name in setup.py. 1.0.0 changed the capitalization from "itsdangerous" to "ItsDangerous", but this caused issues with some systems. The name will remain as "itsdangerous".</p>
<p>We appologize again for the issues and thank everyone in the community who contributed to the discussion.</p>

  <p>It's Dangerous 1.0.0 has been released. See the <a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/changes/#version-1-0-0">changelog</a> for a list of changes since the last release on 2014-03-28.</p>
<p>It's Dangerous provides secure message signing and serialization. Without the secret key used to sign a message, the content cannot be changed without invalidating the signature. This allows, for example, Flask to store information in a session cookie that is transmitted over public networks, and be sure that the data has not been tampered with when loading a subsequent request.</p>
<h2 id="install-or-upgrade">Install or Upgrade</h2><p>Install from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ItsDangerous">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U ItsDangerous
</code></pre>
<h2 id="imports-will-change">Imports will change</h2><p>Previously, It's Dangerous was a single Python module with about 1000 lines of code. The project has been reorganized as a package with submodules, which will make the code easier to navigate going forward.</p>
<p>However, this means that <em>everything</em> that It's Dangerous imported or defined used to be importable from <code>itsdangerous</code>. With the reorganization, only the public API is importable from <code>itsdangerous</code>. To ease transition, "public" was defined as any name that was previously documented in the API section. These compatibility imports will be deprecated and removed in future releases. If you were importing undocumented names, you'll need to import them from the correct submodule now.</p>
<h2 id="read-the-docs">Read the Docs</h2><p>It's Dangerous has moved its docs to Read the Docs. The new URL for the docs is <a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/">https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/</a>.</p>
<p>The docs were previously hosted on PyPI's docs site (<code>pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous</code>), but this site has been deprecated and it is no longer possible to upload new docs there. Unfortunately, due to the deprecation, there is no way to add a redirect to the new docs. As of this release, any URLs pointing to the old site will break.</p>

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Click 7.0. Thank you to everyone who contributed online and in person at the PyCon US 2018 sprint! With the help of the community as well as some new maintainers, we've managed to resolve hundreds of long standing issues and pull requests.</p>
<p>Due to the length of time since the last release, there are a significant number of new features and fixes. <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/master/changelog/#version-7-0">Check out the changelog</a> for a list of all code changes and links to the relevant issues. Changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell autocompletion has improved in a number of areas.<ul>
<li>Native ZSH completion was added, and supports its enhanced parameter documentation.</li>
<li>The choice type can be completed.</li>
<li>Completion correctly handles chained commands, spaces, defaults, and partial completions.</li>
<li>Parameters can provide a callback to customize completion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On Windows <code>click.echo</code> can now output more than 16k characters in one call. On Windows 7, a 64k limit on binary stream output is also worked around.</li>
<li><code>click.getchar</code> returns Unicode on Windows.</li>
<li>When piping input and output, more cases of closed pipes are detected and handled instead of raising errors.</li>
<li>The <code>CliRunner</code> used for testing separates stdout and stderr.</li>
<li>New <code>DateTime</code> and <code>FloatRange</code> parameter types.</li>
<li>Flags to mark a parameter as hidden or deprecated.</li>
<li>Numerous improvements and fixes to i/o, help, parameters, and testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="read-the-docs">Read the Docs</h2><p>Click is the first Pallets project to move its docs to Read the Docs. Our projects currently use a custom builder and hosting, but this became too difficult with limited maintainer time. Thank you to everyone at RTD who helped with the transition!</p>
<p>The new URL for the docs is <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/">https://click.palletsprojects.com/</a>. The old <a href="http://click.pocoo.org/">http://click.pocoo.org/</a> domain will redirect to the new one while we continue to migrate, but will eventually go away. Please use the new URL going forward.</p>
<p>Click's docs use a custom Sphinx theme and extensions. As part of the move, these were extracted to a separate Python package. Install <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Pallets-Sphinx-Themes">Pallets-Sphinx-Themes</a> to use Click's theme when writing extensions for a more cohesive look.</p>

  <p>In May I attended PyCon US 2018 in Cleveland, Ohio. It's a great opportunity to meet people interested in the Pallets projects and Python web applications. It can be a little intimidating, but also a lot of fun. The biggest difficulty is that there are <em>too many</em> things to do, and I always wish everyone could have a few more days together.</p>
<p>During the main conference, while talks are happening, anyone can organize "open spaces," impromptu meetings for any topic. I organized a Pallets open space, and we had a huge turnout. I was kind of unprepared for the size, so we started with people asking me questions, and then split up into tables for new users, Flask, Click, and Jinja.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/pycon-2018-click/open-space-board.jpg" alt="Open space announcement"></p>
<p>For up to four days after the talks, developers get together for sprints, working together to contribute to Python open source projects. Experienced developers help new ones learn how to contribute, and everyone gets to learn about new projects and meet the developers behind them.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/pycon-2018-click/open-space.jpg" alt="Pallets open space"></p>
<p>At the open space, I had mentioned that no one had really been maintaining Click for the past year. It turns out a <em>lot</em> of people use Click. They came motivated from the open space to contribute during the sprint. Some were new to contributing, but they all had one thing in common: they knew how Click was being used more than I did! So I took a chance and gave them all write permissions to the repository. Click started at ~250 open issues and 68 pull requests. After 2 days, it was at 140 issues and 22 pull requests. Wow! With that success, I'm officially welcoming all these new maintainers to the Pallets Click team. While Click stole the show, we had great contributions to Werkzeug, Flask, and Jinja as well.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/pycon-2018-click/sprint-dinner.jpg" alt="Dinner with Pallets sprinters"></p>
<p>If you want to get involved, a great way is to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/watching-and-unwatching-repositories/">watch our repositories on GitHub</a>. You'll get notifications for each issue, so you can see what's happening and start contributing. You can help by triaging issues, improving tests and documentation, and fixing bugs. If your company uses a Pallets project like Flask, Click, or Jinja, consider pointing them to our <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/donate">PSF donation page</a>. Donations will help get maintainers to more events so we can do more sprints like this one. Thank you to everyone at PyCon and in the community for making Pallets a success!</p>

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> 1.0.</p>
<p>The Flask framework has been stable for a long time. A little more than 8 years after the first commit, the version number finally reflects that. 1.0 comes with a significant number of changes representing over a year of work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.</li>
<li>The CLI is more flexible. <code>FLASK_APP</code> can point to an app factory, optionally with arguments. It understands import names in more cases where filenames were previously used. It automatically detects common filenames, app names, and factory names. <code>FLASK_ENV</code> describes the environment the app is running in, like <code>development</code>, and replaces <code>FLASK_DEBUG</code> in most cases. <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/cli/">See the docs to learn more.</a></li>
<li>If python-dotenv is installed, the <code>flask</code> CLI will load environment variables from <code>.flaskenv</code> and <code>.env</code> files rather than having to export them in each new terminal.</li>
<li>The development server is multi-threaded by default to handle concurrent requests during development.</li>
<li><code>flask.ext</code>, which was previously deprecated, is completely removed. Import extensions by their actual package names.</li>
<li>Accessing missing keys from <code>request.form</code> shows a more helpful error message in debug mode, addressing a very common source of confusion for developers.</li>
<li>Error handlers are looked up by code then exception class, on the blueprint then application. This gives more predictable control over handlers, including being able to handle <code>HTTPException</code>.</li>
<li>The behavior of <code>app.logger</code> has been greatly simplified and should be much easier to customize. The logger is always named <code>flask.app</code>, it only adds a handler if none are registered, and it never removes existing handlers. <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/logging/">See the docs to learn more.</a></li>
<li>The <code>test_client</code> gained a <code>json</code> argument for posting JSON data, and the <code>Response</code> object gained a <code>get_json</code> method to decode the data as JSON in tests.</li>
<li>A new <code>test_cli_runner</code> is added for testing an app's CLI commands.</li>
<li>Many documentation sections have been rewritten to improve clarity and relevance. This is an ongoing effort.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/">tutorial</a> and corresponding <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/1.0/examples/tutorial">example</a> have been rewritten. They use a structured layout and go into more detail about each aspect in order to help new users avoid common issues and become comfortable with Flask.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more changes throughout the framework. <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/changelog/">Read the full changelog</a> to understand what changes may affect your code when upgrading.</p>
<h2 id="json-security-fix">JSON Security Fix</h2><p>Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request. Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request.</p>
<p>Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.</p>

  <p>Flask 0.12.2 and Werkzeug 0.12.2 have been released. They contain the same
<strong>security bugfix</strong> for the <code>safe_join</code> function in each package.</p>
<p>The problem only occurs if you are running your application on a Windows
server.</p>
<h2 id="details">Details</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidism">David Lord</a> initially found this bug (thanks!)
and disclosed it to the other maintainers in a private email:</p>
<blockquote><p>While going through PR #2059 about safe_join, I looked up Python's ntpath.join
and discovered a vulnerability that safe_join on Windows doesn't cover.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join">https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join</a>:
"<code>os.path.join("c:", "foo")</code> represents a path relative to the current
directory on drive C: <code>(c:foo)</code>"
<br>
<code>safe_join('\\root\\path', 'd:', 'test.txt')</code> would break out of the trusted
root directory and instead take the test file relative to the cwd on the d
drive.  This doesn't give completely arbitrary path access, since it's
limited to the cwd, but it's still not good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the application developer this means that endpoints using <code>safe_join</code> could
potentially be used to disclose arbitrary files in the server processes'
current working directory on Windows.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next</h2><p>We strongly recommend upgrading to Flask 0.12.2 and Werkzeug 0.12.2, as this
bug has been fixed there (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask/pull/2284">Flask</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/commit/2497866d7eafa64ca5eb4fb3d1747c05036bf318">Werkzeug</a>).</p>
<p>A CVE has been requested on <code>Tue, 16 May 2017 06:51:09 +0000</code>, the CVE <code>CVE-2017-9088</code> was assigned.</p>
