  </p>
  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to announce that the next major versions for
our six core projects have been released!</p>
<p>This represents two years of work by the Pallets team and community,
there are a significant number of changes and exciting new features.
Check out the logs for every project to see what's new. Flask depends on
the five other libraries, be sure to read them all if you're upgrading
Flask.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes#version-2-0-0">Flask 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">Werkzeug 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/changes/#version-3-0-0">Jinja 3.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/changes/#version-8-0">Click 8.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">ItsDangerous 2.0</a></li>
<li><a href="https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">MarkupSafe 2.0</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installing-and-upgrading">Installing and Upgrading</h2><p>Install from PyPI with pip. For example, for Flask:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U Flask
</code></pre>
<p>The projects have all dropped support for Python 2 and 3.5, requiring
Python 3.6 as the minimum supported version. We plan to follow
CPython's supported versions as our supported versions.</p>
<p>Some less common parts of the projects, or parts that we've determined
are better served by external implementations, have been deprecated.
Previously deprecated code has also been removed. Testing tools such as
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> enable showing deprecation warnings
automatically, and can turn them into errors so that you can see early
what you may need to change in your project.</p>
<p>While we strive to avoid compatibility issues, there may turn out to be
incompatibilities either directly or through other dependencies your
project uses, such as Flask extensions. Over the next few weeks, the
ecosystem around our projects will continue to update to improve
compatibility as necessary. We encourage you to use tools such as
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/">pip-compile</a> and
<a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot</a> to pin and control upgrades to
your dependencies to avoid unexpected changes.</p>
<h3 id="renaming-the-default-branch">Renaming the Default Branch</h3><p>We are joining the PSF, CPython, and Django, among many other projects,
in renaming the default branch of our repositories to "main". GitHub
makes this transition easy, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/renaming-a-branch">their documentation about how it works
for maintainers and users</a>.</p>
<p>If you have a local copy of the repository you'll need to rename its
branch to "main".</p>
<pre><code>$ git branch -m master main
$ git fetch origin
$ git branch -u origin/main main
$ git remote set-head origin -a
</code></pre>
<p>If you were installing from a GitHub archive URL such as
<code>https://github.com/pallets/flask/archive/refs/heads/master.zip</code>, you'll
need to rename that link to use "main".</p>
<h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2><p>These are a few of the great new features and changes to be aware of in
the projects. Check out the linked changelogs for the full lists of
changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>All Projects<ul>
<li>Support Python 3.6 and above only. Removing the compatibility code
makes the code faster, as well as easier to maintain and
contribute to.</li>
<li>Comprehensive type annotations have been added to the code. This
makes type checking your own code more useful, and allows IDEs to
provide better completion and help.</li>
<li>Use tools such as pre-commit, black, flake8, and pyupgrade to
ensure the code and new PRs follow the same style consistently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes#version-2-0-0">Flask 2.0</a><ul>
<li>Support async views and other callbacks such as error handlers,
defined with <code>async def</code>. Regular sync views continue to work
unchanged. ASGI features such as web sockets are not supported. We
will continue exploring how to add more support for async.</li>
<li>Blueprints can be nested under other blueprints, allowing a more
layered approach to organizing the application.</li>
<li>Add route decorators for common HTTP API methods. For example,
<code>@app.post("/login")</code> is a shortcut for
<code>@app.route("/login", methods=["POST"])</code>.</li>
<li>Better CLI errors when an app could not be loaded. Running the
development server shows errors immediately, they are only deferred
on reloads.</li>
<li>A new <code>Config.from_file</code> function to load config from any file
format.</li>
<li>The <code>flask shell</code> command enables tab completion like the regular
<code>python</code> shell does.</li>
<li>When serving static files, browsers will cache based on content
rather than a 12 hour timer. This means changes to static content
such as CSS styles will be reflected immediately on reload without
needing to clear the cache.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">Werkzeug 2.0</a><ul>
<li>Parsing <code>multipart/form-data</code> has been optimized and shows a <em>15x</em>
speedup, especially for large file uploads.</li>
<li>Locals use Python's <code>ContextVar</code> to allow working across async
coroutines instead of only threads.</li>
<li>All request and response code has been merged into single classes
instead of composing multiple mixin classes.</li>
<li>While this is not a public API yet, the <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>
classes are becoming sans-io. This will allow us to better support
sync and async use cases in the future.</li>
<li>The test client always returns a <code>Response</code> class that includes a
reference to the original request, environ, and any redirects that
were followed.</li>
<li><code>datetime</code> objects returned by some headers and functions are
timezone-aware.</li>
<li>URL routing understands <code>ws://</code> and <code>wss://</code> schemes and will
route appropriately. While there is no direct support for
websockets, this allows other projects to use Werkzeug's routing.</li>
<li>Move Flask's implementation of <code>send_file</code> and
<code>send_from_directory</code> to Werkzeug.</li>
<li>The debugger no longer uses jQuery, which significantly reduces
the size of the package.</li>
<li>The reloader is smarter about watching or ignoring directories.</li>
<li>The development server avoids showing <code>0.0.0.0</code> and warns about
not running in production.</li>
<li>Colors are shown correctly in the server log on Windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/changes/#version-3-0-0">Jinja 3.0</a><ul>
<li>Async environments and rendering no longer requires patching. This
feature will continue to be improved now that async is natively
supported.</li>
<li>Blocks can be marked as <code>required</code>.</li>
<li>Variables set in blocks or loops can be accessed in context
functions, as well as inner scoped blocks. Macros have access to
the current template globals.</li>
<li>Filters and tests used within <code>if</code> blocks and ternary statements
can be undefined at runtime. Tests have been added to check if a
filter or test is available, to allow optionally using them.</li>
<li>I18N supports <code>pgettext</code> and <code>npgettext</code>.</li>
<li><code>NativeEnvironment</code> supports <code>enable_async</code> mode.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.0.x/changes/#version-8-0">Click 8.0</a><ul>
<li>The shell tab completion system has been completely rewritten. It
now allows every command, group, parameter, and type to provide
custom completion, supports sending metadata such as the type to
the shell for better native support, and provides a way to add
support for new shells.</li>
<li><code>style</code> supports 256 and RGB color codes supported by modern
terminals, as well as the strikethrough, italic, and overline
styles.</li>
<li>New class attributes make it easier to customize the core objects.</li>
<li>The context can manage resources that use context managers across
commands. For example, this makes it easier to manage a database
connection.</li>
<li>Options with <code>multiple=True</code> or <code>nargs</code> don't require setting a
<code>default</code>, and properly validate the format of a default if it's
given.</li>
<li>Options can be used as only a flag to use a default value, or
prompt for a value only if the flag is given.</li>
<li>Prompts validate using the option's custom callback in addition to
its type.</li>
<li>Help formatting and short help message generate has been improved.</li>
<li>Command line arguments on Windows support glob patterns like
<code>*.txt</code> and <code>~/config.json</code>, since the Windows terminal does not
support this automatically.</li>
<li>Messages shown to users, such as validation and errors, are marked
as I18N translatable with <code>gettext</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://itsdangerous.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">ItsDangerous 2.0</a><ul>
<li>Added support for key rotation by passing a list of valid keys
instead of a single key.</li>
<li><code>datetime</code> objects are timezone-aware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://markupsafe.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/changes/#version-2-0-0">MarkupSafe 2.0</a><ul>
<li>Wheels are provided for 33 Python version / OS / architecture
combinations, to make installing with speedups easy. Newly added
are ManyLinux 2014 and OSX Universal 2 wheels.</li>
</ul>
</li>

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release Werkzeug 1.0. Werkzeug is the
low-level WSGI and HTTP toolkit that powers Flask. It's been almost 13
years since the first commit, and this milestone for the project brings
many fixes and changes. <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/changes/#version-1-0-0">Read the full changelog</a>
to understand what may affect your code when upgrading.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 3.4. This will be the last version to
support Python 2.7 and 3.5.</li>
<li>Remove most top-level attributes provided by the <code>werkzeug</code> module
in favor of direct imports. If you haven't already, use
<a href="/blog/werkzeug-0-16-0-released">version 0.16</a> first to see
deprecation warnings while upgrading.</li>
<li>Cookies support the <code>samesite='None'</code> option. Cookies are parsed
as a <code>MultiDict</code> instead of overwriting repeated keys.</li>
<li>The development server supports 2-way TLS, making it easier to
develop applications that inspect client certificates.</li>
<li>When building URLs with host matching, the current host is accounted
for when deciding what rule to build.</li>
<li>When defining and matching URL rules, consecutive slashes are merged
by default to match the behavior of common HTTP servers.</li>
<li>The <code>Accept</code> header preserves order for tags with equal quality and
considers options on each value. The  <code>Accept-Language</code> header can
match the primary tag if the specific value is not present.</li>
<li>Added CORS header attributes to <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code>.</li>
<li>A URL rule can be marked as a <code>websocket</code>, in which case it will
only match for <code>wss://</code> requests. This allows async web frameworks
to use Werkzeug for routing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-2-0-coming-soon">Version 2.0 Coming Soon</h2><p>As outlined in <a href="/blog/ending-python2-support">Ending Python 2 Support</a>,

  <p>The Pallets team is pleased to release <a href="/p/flask/">Jinja</a> 2.11.0.
<a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/changelog/#version-2-11-0">Read the changelog</a>
for the full list of changes. Some of the bigger changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drop support for Python 2.6, 3.3, and 3.4. This will be the last
version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.</li>
<li>A new <code>jinja2.ext.debug</code> extension adds a <code>{% debug %}</code> tag to
quickly dump the current template context.</li>
<li>A new <code>ChainableUndefined</code> type allows silently ignoring attribute
access on undefined variables.</li>
<li>Loop context variables like <code>loop.length</code> and <code>loop.nextitem</code> work
better in both sync and async environments.</li>
<li>Improved compile and runtime performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version-3-0-coming-soon">Version 3.0 Coming Soon</h2><p>As outlined in <a href="/blog/ending-python2-support">Ending Python 2 Support</a>,
2.11.x will be the last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5. The next
version will be 3.0 and will support Python 3.6 and newer.</p>
<p>The package name will remain "Jinja2" and imports will remain <code>jinja2</code>.
"Jinja2 3.0" looks a little weird, but given the years of community
momentum behind the name, we concluded it was less disruptive to keep it
as-is.</p>
<h2 id="install-or-upgrade">Install or Upgrade</h2><p>Install from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Jinja2/">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install -U Jinja2
</code></pre>
<h2 id="donate-to-support-pallets">Donate to Support Pallets</h2><p>The Pallets organization accepts donations as part of the non-profit
Python Software Foundation (PSF). Donations through the PSF support our
efforts to maintain the projects and grow the community.</p>

  <p>Upstream support for Python 2.7 is ending on <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/">January 1, 2020</a>.
Pallets is joining the <a href="https://python3statement.org/">community of open source projects</a>
ending support for Python 2 at that time. Our statement and support plan
are based on <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/5.3.2/py27-py34-deprecation.html">PyTest's announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We will be dropping support for Python 2.7 as well as Python 3.5 and
below, as their support windows have ended or will end around the same
time. Future releases of each Pallets project will only support Python
versions still supported upstream, which can be found in the
<a href="https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches">Python Developer's Guide</a>.</p>
<p>The last version branch of each core project to support Python 2.7
and Python 3.5 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flask 1.1.x</li>
<li>Werkzeug 1.0.x</li>
<li>Click 7.x</li>
<li>Jinja 2.11.x</li>
<li>ItsDangerous 1.1.x</li>
<li>MarkupSafe 1.1.x</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project will receive a major version bump to indicate support
for only 3.6+:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flask 2.0</li>
<li>Werkzeug 2.0</li>
<li>Click 8.0</li>
<li>Jinja 3.0</li>
<li>ItsDangerous 2.0</li>
<li>MarkupSafe 2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the <code>python_requires</code> package metadata, Python 2.7 and
3.5 users with a modern pip version will install the last supported
version automatically even if later versions are available.</p>
<p>The team will no longer backport patches for unsupported versions, but
the branches will continue to exist. The team will be happy to
accept patches contributed by the community for any severe security and
usability issues until mid-2020.</p>
<p>We made this decision based on multiple factors. Foremost is ease of
community contribution and maintainer availability. As time goes on,
fewer contributors have used or are familiar with the differences
between Python 2 and 3. Contributors and maintainers must keep track of
an ever growing list of obscure compatibility issues and workarounds,
and cannot use many modern features.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, we've talked to many developers and teams at
conferences and meetups and heard overwhelming support for the move to
Python 3. This is backed up by data collected from our community in a
survey we ran during January 2019, with 92% of respondents already using
or actively upgrading to Python 3. The <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/#python-3-adoption">PSF developer survey</a> and
PyPI statistics report similar majorities and show adoption continuing
to increase.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone in the community for your support, and to everyone
who has made this transition a reality. We look forward to continuing
to develop the Pallets projects with you!</p>

  </p>
  <p>Werkzeug 0.16.0 has been released. The only change is that most of the
top-level attributes in the <code>werkzeug</code> module are now deprecated, and
will be removed in 1.0.0.</p>
<p>For example, instead of <code>import werkzeug; werkzeug.url_quote</code>, do
<code>from werkzeug.urls import url_quote</code>. If you are using these imports in
your project, a deprecation warning will show the correct import to use.
<code>werkzeug.exceptions</code> and <code>werkzeug.routing</code> should also be imported
instead of accessed, but for technical reasons can’t show a warning.</p>
<p>These imports were supported by patching the <code>werkzeug</code> module to
support lazy imports, but the implementation added complexity, and there
was no clear design reason why some things were available and some
weren't. It also masked some circular dependency issues. IDEs like
PyCharm didn't know those lazy imports existed and were already
correctly using the full imports.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Werkzeug 0.15.5 has been released, containing bug and security fixes.
The <a href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/changes/#version-0-15-5">changelog</a> lists the changes in detail, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> safely handles drive names in paths on Windows.</li>
<li>The reloader no longer causes an <code>Exec format error</code> in many common
situations.</li>
<li>The reloader works around an issue when using the pydev debugger.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-fix-for-shareddatamiddleware-on-windows">Security fix for <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on Windows</h2><p>Prior to 0.15.5, it was possible for a third party to potentially access
arbitrary files when the application used <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on
Windows. This issue was assigned <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14322">CVE-2019-14322</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the way Python's <code>os.path.join()</code> function works on Windows, a
path segment with a drive name will change the drive of the final path.
This was <a href="/blog/flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release/">previously addressed</a> in the <code>safe_join()</code> function in
<a href="/blog/flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release/">Werkzeug 0.12.2</a>, but <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> used a separate
implementation and so was not secured by the previous fix.</p>
<p><code>SharedDataMiddlware</code> now uses <code>safe_join()</code> when fetching requested
files. Projects using <code>SharedDataMiddleware</code> on Windows should update
as soon as possible to receive the fix.</p>
<p>Thank you to <a href="mailto:byemre.ovunc@gmail.com">Emre Övünç</a> and <a href="mailto:security@odoo.com">Olivier Dony</a> for responsibly
reporting the issue. If you think you have discovered a security issue
in Werkzeug or another of the Pallets projects, please email
<a href="mailto:security@palletsprojects.com">security@palletsprojects.com</a> with details.</p>
<h2 id="install-or-upgrade">Install or Upgrade</h2><p>Install from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Werkzeug/">PyPI</a> with pip:</p>
